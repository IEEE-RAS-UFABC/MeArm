This is a chipKit UNO32 based project, it consists in a joystick controlled robotic arm. The arm has its movement provided by 4 micro servo motors, and it's powered by a 12v power supply. The project has two main operation modes: The Control Mode, which the arm only moves when it receives the proper signal from the joystick and the Memory Mode, which it memorizes a limited number of steps and then repites them in a cyclic way.
